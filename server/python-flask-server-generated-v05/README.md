# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m swagger_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080//ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080//swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t swagger_server .

# with tag
docker build -t local/aedestoetsapi:0.5  .

# starting up a container with port mapping
docker run -p 8080:8080 swagger_server
```


To transfer the image we build to a remote host we do.

```
docker save local/aedestoetsapi:0.5   | bzip2 | pv | ssh hugo@149.210.174.128 sudo docker load
```

## Added docker-compose file

Now we can use the image and server the api with the supplied docker-compose file.
Keep in mind we have created a DNS entri for aedes.dikw.nl
